# Getting Started

#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Setup

#### In the project directory, run:

```bash
npm i
```

#### Runs the app in the development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

```bash
npm test 
```

#### Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
